## Welcome! To my Developer Code Compendium!
Here is a easy overview of some of my apps. I've been trying to self-teach a handful of skills and technologies. I am proud of all the resourcefulness and troubleshooting I've expended on all of them, even if the current project isn't the most beautiful looking this. They are all important to me in some way, but there are simply too many to describe on a resume! Thank you for viewing!


### [Personal Website](https://github.com/tabathadelane/tabathadelane.github.io)
[The Website](http://tabathadyoung.com)
I built this version of my website with Vue and deployed it with Github Pages.  
**_Technologies Used: Javascript, Vue, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass_**

### [Personal Website - React Clone](https://github.com/tabathadelane/portfolio-clone-react)
After running through a few tutorials and simple apps using API, I decided to try and 'translate' an existing app to React. This was really fun, and I am confident that I can be just as competent with Vue AND React.  
**_Technologies Used: Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap_**

### [Trversal](https://github.com/tabathadelane/trversal) *- With animated Demo*
This is my MVP version of my bootcamp capstone. It is an iternerary building app that utilizes a lot of Google Maps API's. Click the link to see an animated demo!  
**_Technologies used: Python, Django, Django Rest, SQLite, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vue CDN, Depoloyment (PythonAnywhere)_**

### [Trversal 2.0](https://github.com/tabathadelane/trversal-vue)
I have been working on rebuilding my capstone as a modern SPA using the full Vue CLI. It's a work in progress!  
**_Technologies Used: Python, Django, Django Rest, SQlite, Json Web Token, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vue, Bootstrap, Sass_**

### [Critical Reactions](https://github.com/tabathadelane/critical-reactions) *- With animated Demo*
A mock marketing site for my D&D group's adventuring party. See why you should hire us! I'm working with a fellow member to create flavor text. This is also a work in progress! This was my first attempt at Bootstrap and Sass, so the rest of the app is very simple right. I plan to add a blog.  
**_Technologies Used: Python, Django, Django Rest, SQLite, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vue, Bootstrap, Sass_**

### [VGCT - Video Game Collection Tool](https://github.com/rpedraza01/VGCT)
This was my first attempt to use the full Vue CLI and transition out of static Django templates. It needs some styling, and some user authorization, but I was really excited to be able to hook the full stack app to an additional external API to pull video game information from a serach bar to save to my personal collection! This was a group project with a fellow bootcamp grad. We also learned how to set-up and use PostgreSQL  
**_Technologies Used: Python, Django, Django Rest, PostgreSQL, Javascript, Vue_**

### [Habit@ (Habitat)](https://github.com/serverless-mom/habitat)
This app was built during a 10 hr hackathon. I got to work with some senior developers on a React and AWS Lambda app. It's very simple, but I got to see a lot of new technologies. I wrote the python functions for the Lambda, and did some quick CSS.  
**_Technologies Used: AWS Lambda, Mongo DB, Python, CSS, React_**

## [Pandaid-Backend](https://github.com/Pand-Aid/pandaid-api)
This was a massive volunteer effort from the Portland Dev community to create a tool to help people in need during the pandemic. Unfortunatly, the idea never fully took off, but I did spend several weeks working with senior devs and using bigger technologies. I learned a lot.  
**_Technologies Used: Python, Django. Django Rest, Docker_**
